(“ekubo-license-v1.eth”)

This agreement is entered into by and between Ekubo, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Ekubo”) and you, the party exercising the license granted in this agreement (“Licensee”). By using, copying, modifying or distributing the smart contracts, software and associated materials provided under this agreement, any portion of (together, the “Licensed Work”), you agree to the terms of this agreement. If you do not agree, you must not exercise the rights granted in this agreement. Each condition of this agreement is also a covenant by you. This agreement is made for the express benefit of the Ekubo DAO, the decentralized community of EKUBO token holders acting through governance smart contracts (“Ekubo DAO”), which is a third party beneficiary of this agreement.

1. Grant of Rights

1.1 Subject to Licensee’s compliance with this license, including without limitation the Revenue Sharing Obligation in Section 2, Ekubo hereby grants Licensee, under all of Ekubo’s rights in the Licensed Work, a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, license to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Licensed Work. If Licensee brings a patent claim, or assists any other party to bring a patent claim, over patents that Licensee claims are infringed by the Licensed Work, Licensee’s license ends automatically.

1.2 Notices. Any distribution of the Licensed Work must be made under the terms of this agreement only, and such distribution, as well as any blockchain explorer associated with the Licensed Work, whether it includes the Licensed Work or not, must include the full text of this license (or the statement “Licensed under the Ekubo DAO Shared Revenue License 1.0 at ekubo-license-v1.eth”) and retain all copyright notices in the Licensed Work. Licensee must ensure that parties receiving copies of the Licensed Work from Licensee are bound to this license. 

2. Revenue Sharing 

2.1 Revenue Share. In consideration of the rights granted in this agreement, Licensee shall pay 50% of Licensee’s Protocol Revenue (the “Protocol Revenue Share”) to Ekubo DAO.

2.2 Payment Terms. Licensee shall remit the Protocol Revenue Share no later than 10 business days after the end of each calendar quarter, for amounts accrued in that quarter, via on-chain transfer to Ekubo DAO’s Designated Address. If no Designated Address has been specified, Licensee shall hold the Protocol Revenue Share in trust for Ekubo DAO and shall promptly seek Ekubo DAO’s instruction (e.g., via DAO governance processes) on where and how to remit payment. 

2.3 DAO Governance. Ekubo DAO may, through governance vote, designate or change the Designated Address, set operational details for payments, or clarify the definition of Protocol Revenue. The Ekubo DAO may also reduce the 50% Protocol Revenue Share in its sole discretion. The Ekubo DAO will submit all such changes to its designated blockchain. 

3. Termination

3.1 Automatic Termination. Any material breach of this agreement, including without limitation failure to timely pay the Protocol Revenue Share, automatically terminates the license granted herein, as of the date of breach. Upon termination, Licensee must cease all use of the Licensed Work and delete or destroy any copies of the Licensed Work in Licensee’s possession. 

3.2 Reinstatement. Ekubo may, in its discretion, reinstate the license if Licensee cures the breach (including full payment of Protocol Revenue Share due, plus any reasonable interest or late fees set by DAO governance) and provides reasonable assurances against future breaches.

4. Intellectual Property

4.1 Ownership. Except for the rights expressly granted in Section 1.1, Ekubo reserves all rights in the Licensed Work. 

4.2 Trademarks. This agreement does not grant rights to use Ekubo names, logos, service marks or trademarks, except as necessary to comply with this agreement.
